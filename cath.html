    <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">When moon meet the star</h1>
      <pre style="font-size:100%;text-align:center;" >
In a crowded room, I saw you shine,
Amidst the noise, you were the only sign,
Of starry nights and cosmic skies,
And I couldn't help but fixate my eyes.
 
Like a comet streaking through the night,
You set my heart aglow with your light,
And as we danced, the constellations aligned,
Our souls intertwined; our fates entwined.
        
In the cosmic sphere, your love shone bright,
Like the sun and earth, in perfect sight,
A Leo and Taurus, a match made to last,
A love so powerful, it could outlast.
        
Now we stand under the same sky,
With a love that will never die,
Our connection written in the stars,
A love story, that's ours only ours.
  


<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Meine Liebe</h1>
<pre style="font-size:100%;text-align:center;" > 
Venus in her own right,
A cosmic beauty, shining so bright,
Radiance that illuminates the night,
A dame to behold, a wondrous sight.

Like a galaxy that swirls and spins,
A dance of energy that never ends,
Her gravitational pull draws me in,
Her warmth and light, a cosmic dream.

Your love is a garden,
Where roses bloom in the spring,
I am but a humble bee,
Drawn to your nectar, I cling.

In your eyes, I see the ocean,
Endless and deep,
I am but a sailor,
Lost in your love, unable to sleep.

Your touch is a symphony,
Every note in perfect harmony,
I am but an audience,
Entranced by your melody.

A chasm of mystery,
A celestial dance,
I was left breathless, in your trance,
An abyss of wonder.
