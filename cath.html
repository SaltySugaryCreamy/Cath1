      <pre style="font-size:100%;text-align:center;" >
Venus in her own right,
A cosmic beauty, shining so bright,
Radiance that illuminates the night,
A dame to behold, a wondrous sight.

Like a galaxy that swirls and spins,
A dance of energy that never ends,
Her gravitational pull draws me in,
Her warmth and light, a cosmic dream.

Your love is a garden,
Where roses bloom in the spring,
I am but a humble bee,
Drawn to your nectar, I cling.

In your eyes, I see the ocean,
Endless and deep,
I am but a sailor,
Lost in your love, unable to sleep.

Your touch is a symphony,
Every note in perfect harmony,
I am but an audience,
Entranced by your melody.

A chasm of mystery,
A celestial dance,
I was left breathless, in your trance,
An abyss of wonder.
